The Project uses the python and PHP as programming language. As python is open sourced, easy to understand, highly readable and has a powerful syntax it has been used. And backend functionality is accomplished using php. The Django Framework is used to designed the web pages and Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself. Python is used throughout, even for settings files and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models. On the other hand, php has been implemented inside the CodeIgniter as it is faster as well secured.
The Recommend part is designed with Artificial Intelligence and machine learning tools using the Anaconda environment. The Recommendation engine is fully based on the client-based filtering model.
